				<p>"Never be afriad to take on challenges", is a my  mantra that I follow daily. My name is Phillip Llewellyn. I am a student of the University of the West Indies, Mona and I am apartof a three(3) year programme to complete my bachelors degree in Computer Science. I currently major in COmputer Science and minor in Management Studies. However, my ultimate goal is to develop a world renknown software development/engineering in Jamaica. I have a passion for Artificial Intelligence and robotics and as such have coached the Calabar High and the National robotics team, twice. I am a member of the University computing Society club and work under the AI Sig. Although I prefer to develop on AI I have also develop under the areas of Web development and Mobile development. In the summer of 2019, I worked on an open source platform with the name of Quito under the Calico Palisadoes Internship. I love to learn and I never cease to grab on ending to better my skillset. I will continue to take on challenges and never regret one.</p>
